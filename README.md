# Introduction
ASUC Finance Transformations (ASFINT) is a library containing rudimentary cleaning and transformation scripts that are used to process raw data into cleaned datasets meant to serve as the source of truth on the OCFO Financial Database's warehouse level. 
Functions are design both to be called manually for manual cleaning of records and integrated into automatic workflows for realtime cleaning and integration into the OCFO Database system. 

ASFINT does NOT contain any scripts beyond the data transformation scripts and is agnostic to backend platforms supporting data push and pull functionalities to external cloud platforms.
